  <p class="work-desc"> I like creating graphics that are visually appeals,also it have some purpose, direction and useful.
    At first I just to make them for memes and fake inspirational quotes, from the fictional famous people I made up and posted on the internet to trick people.
    But then I realised it can be used in somewhere else to promote something.
    But now I can make logos, business card, social media pages and posts graphics of all kind.
